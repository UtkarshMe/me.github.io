Hi! My name is Utkarsh Maheshwari. I am a 21 year old kid pursuing my
undergraduate degree in Computer Science from
[BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/). I am an
[ISFP](https://www.16personalities.com/isfp-personality) through and through.

**I love to code.** I have a great interest in application development and
system programming. I am an avid open-source supporter. My soft spot for Linux
is a reason why I am evolving a new passion in OS development. You can find my
humble projects on my [Github](https://github.com/UtkarshMe).

**I love to read.** My favourite genres include black humor and absurdism. I
have a mild interest in philosophy, especially existentialism and nihilism. You
can find more about that on my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/utkarshme).

**I like graphic designing.** I really enjoyed making posters and graphics for
my college fests and events. Unfortunately, I don't seem to have any work to
showcase.

**I like DJing.** I am a huge EDM junkie and spent some years creating sound
tracks. You can find some of it on my
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/utkarshme).


You can find my resume [here](/resume.pdf).
