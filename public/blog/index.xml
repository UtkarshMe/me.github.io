      <description>As is the tradition of BITS, every second yearite is expected to go to an internship to a place and a organization allotted by the institute. I was given AIIMS, Bhopal a budding, new part of the prestigious AIIMS brand. But the problem was it being a hospital! What was I expected to do at a goddamn hospital?! Write code to cure cancer? (interesting&amp;hellip; Maybe, someday?)
The first few days were pretty useless.</description>

      <description>Okay, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote. I got a little busy with my acads is all. But not to worry because I have a new project at hand! Woohoo! And it&amp;rsquo;s finally what I really like to do; low level shiz and not WebDev.
Enough beating around the bush, let me introduce you to, &amp;lsquo;A Vim Story&amp;rsquo;, the new best way to learn Vim. The idea is to make a game out of it and let the user enjoy the steep learning curve, rather than dread it like I did.</description>

      <description>This is so damn exciting! My code is going into the awesome repositories of Gnome! I have always dreamt of coding for something big, something significant and this was the first successful attempt. It was for the Gnome Todo app which I use on a daily basis. I never thought I would one day get to add something to it! Although the bug was really minor and required a one-line change, the feeling and later the comment of the maintainer (Sweet and short.</description>

      <description>Why is this Arch Linux such a big deal among people? It can&amp;rsquo;t be that tough! I&amp;rsquo;ll just install it and see for myself.
So, here I am, installing a new Linux flavor just for the heck of it. But I won&amp;rsquo;t replace my current OS just yet. Let me install it in a virtual box. After an easy download from their website, I have my hands on the iso image and I fire up my virtual box.</description>

      <description>Since I had switched to Elementary OS and I had to tweak it, I foraged the internet for a tweak tool and found it by the name of Elementary Tweaks. Although it looked promising, it soon turned out that it didn&amp;rsquo;t really offer that many customizations. But you can&amp;rsquo;t really blame the devs for this, as the EOS is built with a principle in mind to avoid configurations as much as possible.</description>

      <description>The new OS is in! Welcome, *drumrolls* Elementary OS 0.4 Loki. It was a hard decision really, leaving all the customizability of Ubuntu and switching to the somewhat constricted Loki. But the best part about it is that Loki doesn&amp;rsquo;t require that amount of customization. The UI looks, and feels, like a Mac but there are a few differences here and there. Actually, there are many. Nonetheless, being built from Ubuntu, the transition wasn&amp;rsquo;t much a difference, except for the escape from the Unity look that bored me to death.</description>

      <description>It was a pain in the ass, logging into the internet portal again and again and again. A script was needed and it was needed badly. Presenting the BitsnetLogin v1.0.0. A complete cli program in itself with a launcher app. The options in the current release include (but are not limited to) logging into the Hostel LAN and WiFi and Academic block wifi. The app is designed for unix/linux based systems only for the moment.</description>

      <description>So the customary Hello world was in line. There. I said it. The program seems to be working fine. Anyways, this first post is basically for describing what and why. The motivation and reason for this is not a very grand one, but nonetheless important. This blog serves as a journal, for me and for whoever it may concern, of stuff I explore and venture into during my days on this planet (and any other planet).</description>
