      <description>Okay, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote. I got a little busy with my acads is all. But not to worry because I have a new project at hand! Woohoo! And it&amp;rsquo;s finally what I really like to do; low level shiz and not WebDev.

The motivation and reason for this is not a very grand one, but nonetheless important. This blog serves as a journal, for me and for whoever it may concern, of stuff I explore and venture into during my days on this planet (and any other planet).</description>
