                <p>So I had enough of Gnome breaking every now and then, filling up my RAM with all sorts of unwanted services and decided to switch to something new. I wanted something that would reduce the whole dependency cycle; something which does not make you choose between eye-candy and performance.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3wm</a> caught my eye, which claims to be &ldquo;targeted at advanced users and developers.&rdquo; I looked around for some screenshots for how does it look and was surprised to find that every one of them was drastically different from the other.</p>

<p>I3wm is a tiling manager and not a desktop environment which makes it lighter and thus faster than Gnome or KDE or any other desktop environment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do we do when we want any information regarding a Linux?</p>

<p><strong>Arch Wiki!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/i3">Arch Wiki</a> page is pretty well written and gets you started with enough information to get it up and running. The <a href="https://i3wm.org/docs/">docs</a> page of i3wm is quite rich and provides all you need to know to fully configure your desktop. <em>The only limit is your creativity!</em></p>

<p><br>
Here&rsquo;s what the setup looks like:
<img src="/img/i3wmsetup.jpg" alt="My i3 setup" title="My i3 setup" /></p>

<p>I would recommend using <a href="https://github.com/Airblader/i3">i3-gaps</a> which is a fork of i3 with some enhancements like the gaps between windows.</p>

<p>What I have come to love about i3 is how fast I can navigate between windows. I hate using my touchpad unless absolutely necessary and that is exactly what i3 eliminated. I don&rsquo;t have to even think about it and all work is done by my muscle memory. I have my key bindings close to Vim which makes the task even more easier.</p>

<p>I have put all the setup configuration <a href="https://github.com/UtkarshMe/i3-config">here</a>. Because I am never satisfied with a configuration (hehe), I will keep updating it till I don&rsquo;t switch to another display manager.</p>
