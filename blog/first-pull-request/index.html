                <p>Since I had switched to Elementary OS and I had to tweak it, I foraged the
internet for a tweak tool and found it by the name of <a href="https://github.com/elementary-tweaks/elementary-tweaks">Elementary
Tweaks</a>. Although it
looked promising, it soon turned out that it didn&rsquo;t really offer that many
customizations. But you can&rsquo;t really blame the devs for this, as the EOS is
built with
<a href="https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines#avoid-configuration">a principle</a>
in mind to avoid configurations as much as possible. It does provide speed but
on the opportunity cost of configuring the applications to the user&rsquo;s
preference.</p>

<p><img src="https://debugandstuff.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/screenshot-from-2017-03-04-201334.png" alt="screenshot-from-2017-03-04-201334" /></p>

<p>Going back to the point that this post is about, I was exploring the source
code and realized that it essentially was just modifying the settings in the
applications database. As this tool interested me greatly, I decided to why not
add a few more settings for the user and quickly forked the repo to my own
<a href="https://github.com/UtkarshMe">Github account</a>. I made a few edits here and
there to add about 4 featured and decided to push these for the developer.</p>

<p>Creating a pull request for the first time was an experience of mixed emotions.
<em>Should I really create this request? Will my code be good enough for them?
Will this even be worth their time?</em> And after an FAQ session with myself, I
thought, &ldquo;What the heck? Let&rsquo;s just do it,&rdquo; and opened a
<a href="https://github.com/elementary-tweaks/elementary-tweaks/pull/41">pull request</a>.
My first pull request to an open source organization! Although it didn&rsquo;t get
merged with the code, it did receive positive comments from the developer
himself and that made my day! I still have these changes in my own fork and am
using it in my system. To see and/or use these, you can always find my repo
<a href="https://github.com/UtkarshMe/elementary-tweaks/tree/mine">here</a>.
Happy customizing!</p>
