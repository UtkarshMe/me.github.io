Hi! My name is Utkarsh Maheshwari. I am a 22 year old kid pursuing my
undergraduate degree in Computer Science from
[BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/).

**I love to code.** I have a great interest in application development and
system programming. I am an avid open-source supporter. My soft spot for Linux
is a reason why I am evolving a new passion in OS development. You can find my
humble projects on my [Github](https://github.com/coditva).

**I love to read.** My favourite genres include black humor and absurdism. I
have a mild interest in philosophy, especially existentialism and nihilism. You
can find more about that on my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/coditva).

You can find my resume [here](/resume.pdf).
