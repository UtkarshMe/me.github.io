### Introvert, systems programmer, reader, amateur photographer, wannabe chef, bass player, nighttime philosopher.

I graduated from [BITS Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/) in 2019 with the major in Computer Science.

I spent some time on front-end dev before switching to back-end. Currently, I am working as a systems programmer and trying my hand at OS development.
