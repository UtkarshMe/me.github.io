### Introvert, systems programmer, reader, amateur photographer, wannabe chef, bass player, nighttime philosopher.

I graduated from [BITS Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/) in 2019 with the major in Computer Science.

I have worked as an intern at [AIIMS, Bhopal](https://www.aiimsbhopal.edu.in/) and [PBS Professional](https://github.com/pbspro) team at [Altair, Bangalore](https://www.altair-india.in/). Currently I'm employed at [Postman, Bangalore](https://getpostman.com) as a full-time software engineer.

I spent some time on front-end dev before switching to back-end. Currently, I am working as a systems programmer and trying my hand at OS development.
