> Long nights and a laptop. And a cup of coffee. And WiFi. And music.

This blog is about the adventures of a boy who slayed the dragon and brought
peace to the land and ocean, far and wide.

Nah, just kidding. It's an ordinary blog about the activities of an ordinary
guy. By an ordinary guy. Nothing special.

I blog irregularly. Why? Well, blogging isn't my first love. But there are times
when I feel like writing stuff and that stuff shows up here. Thanks for taking 
the time to read it.
