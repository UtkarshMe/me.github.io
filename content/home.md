> Long nights and a laptop. And a cup of coffee. And WiFi. And music.

This blog is about the adventures of a boy who slayed the dragon and brought
peace to the land and ocean, far and wide.

Nah, just kidding. It's an ordinary blog about the activities of an ordinary
guy. By an ordinary guy. Nothing special.

But let me tell you that I blog irregularly. Why? Well, let's face it, blogging
isn't my first love. But there are times when I feel like writing stuff and
that stuff shows up here. Thanks for taking the time to read it. I appreciate
it.

I like coding and I believe that writing code is an art which must be
considered the same. Code should be written for other humans to read rather
than for dumb machines.

A piece of code can be _beautiful_ in the same sense that a poem is for those
who have the ability to understand and appreciate it. I like to think that I am
an aspiring artist in the same way that a painter is and I really enjoy the
company of other artists.
